Forked by Ben Griffiths

Which is is a fork of simonw's original mytweets script:

mytweets is a script to back up all your and your friends' tweets to 
local files.

It saves them as CSV.

Notes:
1) mytweets requires python-oauth2 from 
   http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2
2) python-oauth2 in turn requires httplib2 from  
   http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/
3) mytweets requires Python 2.6

Directions:
1) Put fetch.py in any directory

2) Run 'chmod +x fetch.py'

3) Create a file called config.py in the same directory as the fetchy.py 
   script.

4) Set up your Twitter account with a new app:
    a) Go to http://dev.twitter.com/ and log in with your Twitter account.
    b) Click 'Register an app' (or 'Your apps' and then 'Register a new
       app').
    c) Fill out the form.
        * Set 'Application Name' (it won't be publicly visible unless 
          you also use this app to post tweets).
        * Set 'Application website' (it's required).
        * Set 'Application Type' to 'Client'.
        * Set 'Default access type' to 'Read-only' (unless you're 
          going to post tweets using this app).
        * The other fields can be left blank if you like.

5) From the next page copy and paste the 'Consumer key' and 'Consumer 
   secret' into config.py. Then click the 'My Access Token' link on the
   right of the page and copy the 'Access Token (oauth_token)' and 
   'Access Token Secret (oauth_token_secret)' into config.py, eg:

    CONSUMER_KEY = 'Esdfy8iSDF89vdaDFSa789'
    CONSUMER_SECRET = 'DFYUK89fddsfadFDDFS789vsdCXUdfs789xcvDSFH'
    ACCESS_TOKEN = '74382-89FDSHJKjkdsfsfFDSY89SFDFES8978dfsfsda78fdl'
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = '0dfsYFDSs789SDF7uyfdshjksdf789SFSDFHJKSDF'
    
6) Add the FILE_PATH to where you want the resulting file of tweets to be 
   saved, into config.py: 

    FILE_PATH = '/path/to/the/file/we/will/create'

    or use the -f option on the command line.
   
8) Run the command like so:

   ./fetch.py [-f /path/to/the/file/we/will/create/]
   
   It can take a long time to run first time round as later pages of 
   results can take a long time to be returned from Twitter.
   
9) Run the command again at any time to save any tweets created since you 
   last ran the script.
